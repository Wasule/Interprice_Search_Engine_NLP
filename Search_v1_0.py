# s2="ASTHAMON"

###Please note:
# The files Data_Cleaning_Structured_v1_0.py and Indexing_v1_0.py are required to be in same directory as this file.
# This directory's address needs to be mentioned in line 8 of this code.
# The output of Indexing_v1_0.py (i.e., the 2 pickle files) are uploaded in this code at lines 149 and 152 directly from the local machine by typing their addresses.


###To Do:
#The function to clean data needs to be merged into a single function in Data_Cleaning_Structured_v1_0.py and Search_v1_0.py file.
#Hence, we can eleminate the 2nd argument from the search() function.
